# DATA7703_project
The implementations of DATA7703 project: Brisbane wind speed forcasting using Bagging-RNN

### Steps:
1. "Data pre-processing_first.ipynb" for first data cleaning and preprocessing. <br>
2. "data_clearning.py" for 24-hour-structure dataset. <br>
3. Then, you can run any model. <br>

- "main_b_rnn.py" for the proposed Bagging-RNN
- "main_rnn.py" for the single RNN
- "Support Vector Machine Regression_edit.ipynb" for SVR
- "Random Forest Regression.ipynb" for RF
- "MLP_model.ipynb" for MLP

### Require packages: 
pytorch <br>
scikit-learn <br>
pandas <br>
numpy <br>
matplotlib
